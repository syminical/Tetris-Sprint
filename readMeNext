How I compile:

	clear;javac @options @sources

		options and sources are magic txt files
		you need to make your own 'classes' directory
			if you want it; otherwise remove the -d line in options
				it just keeps the .class files out of sight

How I run:

	java -cp classes Sorcery

The jar is executable (double-clickable, but you can also:

	java -jar TetrisSprint.jar

*all of these are run from the top directory (inside Tetris-Sprint)*
